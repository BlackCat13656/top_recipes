            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Whisk together 1 cup cream and cocoa powder. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and boil/simmer for 30 seconds whisking constantly.</li>
                    <li>Remove from heat and add chopped chocolate and whisk until smooth. Add remaining 1 cup of cream and whisk to combine.</li>
                    <li>Transfer mixture to a large bowl and position a fine mesh strainer over it. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>In a small bowl, whisk together egg yolks.</li>
                    <li>In a saucepan over medium heat, whisk together milk, sugar and sea salt.</li>
                    <li>Once the milk mixture is slightly warm, add Â½ cup of warm milk to the beaten egg yolks and whisk to combine. Add the milk/egg mixture back into the saucepan, whisking during the addition.</li>
                    <li>Continue to cook the custard over medium heat, and stir the mixture constantly with a spatula until the it thickens and lightly coats the spatula (it does this when it reaches about 170 degrees F).</li>
                    <li>Pour the thickened custard through the metal strainer into the other ingredients in the bowl. Stir until combined. Discard any custard residue left on the strainer.</li>
                    <li>Add the vanilla and stir to combine.</li>
                    <li>Place a lid on top and let the mixture cool in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours, or overnight. To speed up the cooling process, you can place the container of the chocolate ice cream liquid base into an ice bath and stir it often.</li>
                    <li>Once the ice cream mixture is chilled, churn it in an ice cream maker until thick and frozen (30-40 minutes).</li>
                    <li>Transfer to an airtight container and freeze for at least 6 hours.</li>
                    <li>Serve!</li>
