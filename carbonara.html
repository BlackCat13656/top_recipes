        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is a real spaghetti carbonara recipe made the traditional Italian way, without a single drop of cream. 
            It relies solely on egg and cheese to make a luscious, creamy carbonara sauce. 
            Food fit for a king (or queen!) that proves simple can be magnificent.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>175 g guancialle (substitute with pancetta or bacon)</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>2 egg yolks</li>
                <li>100 g parmigiano reggiano, finely shredded (substitute with pecorino romano)</li>
                <li>0.25 tsp ground black pepper</li>
                <li>400 g spaguetti</li>
                <li>1 tbs kosher salt</li>
                <li>125 ml cup pasta cooking water</li>
                <li>1 garlic clove, optional</li>
                <h4>Garnish (Optional)</h4>
                <li>Parmigiano regianno, finaly shreeded (substitute with percorino romano)</li>
                <li>Parsley, finely chopped</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Guanciale - Cut into 0.5cm / 1/5" thick slices then into batons.</li>
                <li>Carbonara sauce - Place eggs and yolks in a large bowl. Whisk to combine. 
                    Then stir in the parmesan and pepper.</li>
                <li>Cook pasta - Bring 4 litres (4 quarts) of water to the boil with the salt. 
                    Add pasta and cook per the packet directions.</li>
                <li>Reserve pasta water - Just before draining, scoop out 1 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta.</li>
                <li>Cook guanciale - While the pasta is cooking, place guanciale in a non stick pan over medium high heat. 
                    Cook for 4 to 5 minutes until golden. No oil needed - as the guanciale heats up, the fat will melt so it fries in its own fat. 
                    If using garlic, add it in the last minute.</li>
                <li>Pasta in pan - Tip the hot pasta into the pan and toss to coat in guanciale fat.</li>
                <li>Mix pasta in sauce - Transfer the pasta and any residual fat in the pan into the bowl with the egg. 
                    Add 1/2 cup (125 ml) pasta cooking water. 
                    Stir vigorously using the handle of a wooden spoon for 1 minute and watch as the sauce transforms from watery to creamy and clings to the pasta strands!</li>
                <li>Serve - Transfer into warm bowls. 
                    Serve immediately, garnished with a little extra parmigiana reggiano if desired, and a pinch of black pepper and finely chopped parsley.</li>
            </ol>
